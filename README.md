Powershell method of sending simple text data to an IRC server and channel

This is a PoC for a light-weight and minimalized way of sending a message to an IRC channel via Powershell. It is not intended to offer any client interactions or bot functionality. If you need a more fully-featured client/bot, take a look at projects like [Run-IrcBot](https://github.com/alejandro5042/Run-IrcBot).

Simply change the values for your needs. You can verify it works by visiting the server and channel on another IRC client.

This was tested on open.ircnet.net and irc.irc4fun.net. If you use another server and the message does not arrive, you may need to alter the script to handle that server's specific authentication process.
